# Start by typing: 
# docker-compose up -d or via CLI docker compose up -d
# Stop by typing: 
# docker-compose down -v (-v will delete all unnecessary volumes) or via CLI docker compose down -v

# docker-compose is a but dump - you have to tell it to re-build the image if changes have been made.
# docker compose up -d --build
